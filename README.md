## About Me
I have been involved in environmental education and climate change research for nearly 20 years, working at a zoo before college, then at science museums, public schools, and federal government agencies before finding my passion as a classroom science teacher. I love that I get to inspire students just like the teachers I remember who pushed me to success.

Through these experiences, I have spoken in front of large audiences, written curriculum for all age groups, and developed multimedia demonstrations of complex datasets for storytelling. My scientific research has focused on making digital tools that combine datasets, such as museum collections, maps, and climate models, with education and policy. Alongside my research, I have been involved in many different educational roles including while running summer camps at a zoo, organizing after-school tutoring for middle school students, and overseeing a mentor-mentee program for a science museum. I am now excited to bring my scientific training and passion for education together in a in my own classroom.

Previously, I was proud to serve my community as an AmeriCorps VISTA, authoring a guidebook for STEM mentoring programs at the Carnegie Science Center Fab Lab in collaboration with Citizen Schools and Mentoring Partnership. I was also responsible for expanding the capacity of mentor programming at the Fab Lab, identifying sustainable solutions using STEM education to address chronic poverty and inequitable education, and developing mentoring resources to share with the global network of Fab Labs.

Before that, I worked in the federal government for NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) and then at the National Science and Technology Council for the White House to translate publicly funded research about climate change into reports and tools that engage and educate local communities.

## Teaching Experience
__Science Teacher and STEM Program Coordinator__   
Central Catholic High School, Wheeling, WV, Jan 2020 - Present
+ Performed all duties as the sole teacher for Physics, Environmental Science, Robotics, and Engineering classes.
